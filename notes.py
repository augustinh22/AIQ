# Every word or symbol that does a thing and what:
    * '\n' # new lines
    * '\t' # tab
    * '%' # format character
        # %s is for strings (users)
        # %r is for raw representation (debugging for programmers)
        # %d is for numbers (users)
        # %.2f is for floats with two digits after the decimal
    * pydoc # searches docs for function listed afterwards
        # functions (e.g. file.seek) can also be specifically searched
    * os
    * sys
    * Tkinter # adds GUI functionality
    *

*[] Make Ex 20 loop properly in Python

##############NOTE##############
# Python is an object-oriented interpreted language
# Compare the different format characters.
# %s and %d for users
# %r for debugging, "raw programmer's" version, or representation
#     - for non-ASCII symbols, for example, the codes will be printed
#        if %s is used, the character will be printed
#
# What is the difference between using format characters and simply adding strings together as variables?
#
# More than 80 characters per line is *BAD* style
#
# Commas stop a new line from being created (e.g. after print)
#
# pydoc FUNCTION   (gives help for function, press "q" to quit)
#  - check out open, file, os, sys
#
#  If you have integers/numbers as input for raw_input it has to look
#  like this: int(raw_input()) which converts it.
